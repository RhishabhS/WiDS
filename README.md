# WiDS (Winter in data science)

This is the set of assignments that was done by me as part of a bootcamp conducted by the Analytics Club at IIT Bombay. The first part consisted of basic EDA, while the second part consisted of using ML models for predicting 10 year coronary heart disease risk (framingham.csv) and predicting house prices using Boston house price data (boston.csv).
